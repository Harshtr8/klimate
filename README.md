# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



Weather App Project
This Weather App is a modern, feature-rich web application built using React, TypeScript, and a host of cutting-edge technologies. It leverages the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data and provides an intuitive and visually appealing user interface with Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts.

Key Features
Real-Time Weather Data: Powered by the OpenWeather API.
Interactive Graphs: Use Recharts to visualize weather trends.
Advanced State Management: Efficient data fetching and caching with TanStack Query.
Modern UI Components: Built with Shadcn UI and styled using Tailwind CSS.
Type Safety: Implemented in TypeScript for better maintainability and fewer bugs.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across devices.
Tech Stack
React: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
TypeScript: Strongly-typed JavaScript for safer code.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for fast UI styling.
TanStack Query: Powerful data fetching and state management library.
Recharts: Library for building charts and data visualizations.
Shadcn UI: Modern, accessible UI components.
OpenWeather API: Provides weather data.

2. Forecast
Provides a 5-day forecast with interactive charts.
3. Search Functionality
Search for weather information by city name.
4. Responsive Design
Optimized for both mobile and desktop users.
5. Data Visualization
Recharts are used for rendering temperature and humidity trends in an interactive graph.
6. Dark Mode
Fully supports dark mode for better user experience.
How It Works
The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API using TanStack Query for caching and managing asynchronous data.
Weather data is displayed in an interactive, responsive UI designed with Shadcn components and styled using Tailwind CSS.
Recharts provide dynamic and visually appealing graphs for weather trends.
Future Enhancements
Add user authentication to save favorite locations.
Implement geolocation for automatic weather data based on user location.
Enhance error handling and offline support.
